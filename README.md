# Hey, I'm Josh Zayne 👋

I spent six years in the Navy and Air Force as a behavioral health technician, then audited $75M in federal programs at the VA. Now I build systematic trading strategies and risk models as Head of Multi-Asset Strategies at Dimaskus Capital.

That path might seem random, but the throughline is the same: **finding signal in noise**—whether that's in a patient's chart, a federal budget, or overnight futures data.
